# Charles' Dot Files
## Description
This is a collection of my dot files.

Some of them have been around since college when I stole them from other
people. Some of theme are much newer than that.

## Installing

I'm using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage the
linking of all of the dot files. Still working getting it all cleaned up, but
it's getting there.
